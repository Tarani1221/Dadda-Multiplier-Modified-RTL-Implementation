# Dadda-Multiplier-Modified-RTL-Implementation
This repository contains Verilog RTL implementations of Dadda multipliers with various configurations and optimizations. The Dadda multiplier is a parallel structured multiplier known for its speed and efficiency compared to traditional array multipliers.

## File Descriptions:

1. **dadda4_FA**:
   - Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit Dadda multiplier using full adders.

2. **dadda4_HA_CSLA_BEC1**:
   - Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit Dadda multiplier using half adders, carry-select adder (CSLA), and a binary to excess-1 (BEC1) converter.

3. **fulldadda4_FA**:
   - Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit full Dadda multiplier using full adders.

4. **fulldadda4_HA_CSLA_BEC1**:
   - Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit full Dadda multiplier using half adders, CSLA, and BEC1.

5. **dadda8_FA**:
   - Verilog RTL code for an 8-bit Dadda multiplier using full adders.

6. **dadda8 HA-CSLA-BEC1**:
   - Verilog RTL code for an 8-bit Dadda multiplier using half adders, CSLA, and BEC1.

## Usage:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the desired Verilog files using a Verilog synthesis tool.
3. Synthesize and simulate the RTL designs to verify functionality and performance.
4. Modify the RTL code as necessary for your specific design requirements or optimizations.

## Contribution:
Contributions to the repository are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests for improvements, bug fixes, or additional implementations of Dadda multipliers.
