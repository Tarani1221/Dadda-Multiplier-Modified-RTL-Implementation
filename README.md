## Description

This repository contains Verilog RTL code and testbenches for various implementations of Dadda multipliers. A Dadda multiplier is a hardware circuit used for fast multiplication of binary numbers. In this repository, we explore two main approaches for implementing Dadda multipliers: using full adders and a novel approach called the half adder-based carry-select adder with a binary to excess-1 converter (HA_CSLA_BEC1).

### Contents:

1. **Full Adder-Based Implementations:**
   - **Dadda_4bit_usingFullAdder.sv:** Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit Dadda multiplier using full adders.
   - **Dadda_8bit_using_FullAdder.sv:** Verilog RTL code for an 8-bit Dadda multiplier using full adders.
   - **FullDadda_4bit_using_FullAdders.sv:** Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit full Dadda multiplier using full adders.

2. **Half Adder-Based CSA-BEC1 Implementations:**
   - **Dadda_4bit_using_HA_CSLA_BEC1.sv:** Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit Dadda multiplier using half adders, carry-select adder (CSLA), and a binary to excess-1 (BEC1) converter.
   - **Dadda_8bit_using_HA_CSLA_BEC1.sv:** Verilog RTL code for an 8-bit Dadda multiplier using half adders, CSLA, and BEC1.
   - **FullDadda_4bit_using_HA_CSLA_BEC1.sv:** Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit full Dadda multiplier using half adders, CSLA, and BEC1.
